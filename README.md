Experiments with the C->Haskell (C2HS) Interface Generator for Haskell.

This small project demonstrates an easy use-case of the excellent C2HS interface
generator. Additional information is available in this [this StackOverflow
question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12070800/cant-get-c2hs-with-foreign-pointers-to-work).
The initial intent to write the StackOverflow question was a problem I had with
C2HS. The problem is now solved (as you can see in my response) and the source
code checked in here already covers the solution.
